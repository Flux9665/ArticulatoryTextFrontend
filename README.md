## Graphemes to Articulatory Features in over 7000 Languages

This is a text-processing frontend that converts graphemes to phonemes and then further converts those phonemes into
articulatory features, for over 7000 languages.

Have a look at `run_grapheme_to_feature_demo.py` for a demonstration on how to use this tool.

Also, check out the interactive demo to get an impression without any installation
hassle: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Flux9665/ArticulatoryFeatures

This is a standalone version of the text frontend used in the IMS Toucan TTS
toolkit: https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/IMS-Toucan
